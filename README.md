This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at runtime because the loop attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds. This example highlights the importance of careful array index handling in Java programming.
